# Overview — letsbuildke

Purpose

This documentation set provides a structured, practical blueprint for applying automation and AI across a construction company's lifecycle: from executive strategy and pre-construction through procurement, site operations, quality, HSE, finance, and handover.

How this repo is organized

- `docs/prd.md` — the main product/blueprint details and automation map.
- `docs/operations.md` — operational foundation, governance, data, and compliance items required before automation.
- `README.md` — gateway and quick links.

How to use these documents

- Executives: read `docs/prd.md` for portfolio-level automations and strategic priorities.
- Delivery/Operations: read `docs/operations.md` to ensure foundations (SOPs, data governance, supplier enablement) are in place before automating.
- Engineers & implementers: use `docs/prd.md` as a checklist for system integrations, AI agents, and automation flows.
