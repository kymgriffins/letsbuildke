# Operational Foundation & Governance

Automation succeeds only when a company has strong operational foundations. This file collects the structural, non-obvious items required to make automation reliable and scalable.

Key areas

- Standardization: SOPs, naming conventions (drawings, WBS, cost codes), templates (RFIs, submittals, contracts).
- Data quality & governance: data owners, dictionaries, validation rules, BIM execution plans.
- Regulatory & compliance: permit tracking, environmental monitoring, contract standards, insurance integration.
- Organizational alignment: new roles (BIM manager, data lead), change management, training.
- Sustainability & ESG: carbon tracking, certifications, automated ESG reporting.
- Legal & risk: claims preparation, risk register automation, early-warning systems.
- Partnerships & ecosystem: vendor APIs, supplier integration, subcontractor enablement.
- Financial planning: capital planning, ERP choices, cost-to-benefit analysis.
- Cybersecurity: device policies, zero-trust, encryption, penetration testing.
- Scalability & interoperability: cloud strategy, data formats (IFC, COBie, ISO 19650), model lifecycle.
- Human performance: KPIs, training, productivity analytics.

Implementation notes

- Treat these items as prerequisites before automating mission-critical workflows.
- Where possible, document owners and timelines for each foundation item during pilot phases.

Refer to `docs/prd.md` for automation mappings that depend on the items here.
